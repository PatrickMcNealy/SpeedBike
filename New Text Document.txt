Okay, so at this point, we need levels to generate themselves... 
We need art (Alex)... 
we need Facebook / Google connectivity... 



Scoreboard Info:
-Player completes level, gets score.
-Uploads score to server
-Server stores score and display name
-Player can pull scores from server into game; view them from menu

Most of these things can be handled through GPlay services.
